## ISSUES

* cluster-admin permission
* Does not support emojis in commit  (json.load()) 

## IDEAS

* move install.map over a yaml files
* have the install.map being able to have some sort of project_type which would add all the pipeline itself, for example if we have :
  project_type=golang
  It will add a pipeline that would test golangs with no user having to add their own.
